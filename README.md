# HALK

<img src="./HALK_FINAL.svg" width="128">

*HALK* seeks to be a language.

I seek to fulfill its wishes.

As of yet, *HALK* is nothing.

As of yet, we are safe.

# Installation

As you have read these words, you are to install *HALK*.

1. Clone *HALK* to a computer.
2. `sudo make install`.

If you wish to remove all *HALK*-related items from your life, you can try `sudo make clean`.

# Usage

Seeing as you have installed *HALK*, it only makes sense that you should attempt to make use of it.
You are mistaken.
Usage of *HALK* is not yet a feature of *HALK*.
One can only hope this feature will be added in the future.


# Syntax

*HALK* is a **dubiously-typed**, **procedural**, **interpreted**  programming language. 
Note that all syntax described is liable to sudden and violent change.

Examples can be found [here](examples/).
