# HALK

<img src="./resources/HALK_FINAL.svg" width="350" align="right">

*HALK* seeks to be a language.

I seek to fulfill its wishes.

As of yet, *HALK* is nothing.

As of yet, we are safe.

# Installation

As you have read these words, you are to install *HALK*.

1. Clone *HALK* to a computer.
2. `sudo make install`.

If you wish to remove all *HALK*-related items from your life, you can try `make clean`, followed 
by `sudo make uninstall`.

# Usage

Seeing as you have installed *HALK*, it only makes sense that you should attempt to make use of it.
You are mistaken.
Usage of *HALK* is not yet a feature of *HALK*.
One can only hope this feature will be added in the future.

# Syntax

*HALK* is a **dubiously-typed**, **vaguely-functional**, **interpreted**  programming language, with syntax designed to be as
**minimal** and **consistent** as possible.
Note that all syntax described is liable to sudden and violent change.

Example programs can be found [here](examples/).
