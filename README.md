# HALK

*HALK* seeks to be a language.

I seek to fulfill its wishes.

As of yet, *HALK* is nothing.

As of yet, we are safe.

# Installation

As you have read these words, you are to install *HALK*.
There is no turning back.

1. Clone *HALK* to a computer.
2. `sudo make install`.
3. Congratulations; You are now part of The.

# Usage

Seeing as you have installed *HALK*, it only makes sense that you should attempt to make use of it.
You are mistaken.
Usage of *HALK* is not yet a feature of *HALK*.
One can only hope this feature will be added in the future.


# Syntax

*HALK* is a **dubiously-typed**, **procedural** programming language. 
Note that all syntax described is liable to sudden and violent change.

```HALK
let variable = 4;
let another_variable = "Hello, World!";

fn main /
   for variable > 0 /
      say another_variable;
      variable -= 1;
   \
   say "done.";
\
```

***HALK*** **progress:** 10%
